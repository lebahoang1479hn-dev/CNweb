        HTML is heavily used for creating pages that are displayed on the world wide web. Every page contains a set of HTML tags including hyperlinks which are used for connecting to other pages. Every page that we witness, on the world wide web, is written using a version of HTML code.
        Syntax is the arrangement of elements and attributes to create well-formed documents. ... In HTML, this is the purpose of elements and attributes, and the logical (sense and reference) relationship between elements and the attributes of those elements.
        This is because HTML is not a programming language. Unfortunately, coding only in HTML doesn't make you a programmer. ... But don't worry, even with pure HTML, you're still a coder. You're writing lines of code in a (markup, not programming) language.
